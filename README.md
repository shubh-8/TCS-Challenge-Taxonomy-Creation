# TCS-Challenge-Taxonomy-Creation

#### Out of 5 problems, I choose Taxonomy Creation problem. This is a Tag prediction based problem. In which we have to create a hierarchy of tags, also known as Taxonomy.
#### Data Source: https://www.kaggle.com/c/facebook-recruiting-iii-keyword-extraction/data
#### Stack Exchange has released this data which consist of Question description, Titles and their Tags.

<p>
Stack Exchange is a network of question-and-answer websites on topics in diverse fields, each site covering a specific topic. The primary purpose of each Stack Exchange site is to enable users to post questions and answer them.<br />
<br />
Our task is to predict the tags (a.k.a. keywords, topics, summaries), given only the question text and its title and create hierarchy of tags. The dataset contains content from disparate stack exchange sites, containing a mix of both technical and non-technical questions.<br />
<br />
</p>
### Problem Statemtent : Predict the tags based on the content of the questions posted on Stack Exchange sites and form taxonomy.

#### Taxonomy Creation on StackExchange Tag Prediction Problem.ipynb is the ipython notebook which consists of the code.
#### NB_model.sav is the saved MultinomialNB model.
