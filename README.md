# TCS-Challenge-Taxonomy-Creation

#### Out of 5 problems, I choose Taxonomy Creation problem. This is a Tag prediction based problem. In which we have to create a hierarchy of tags, also known as Taxonomy.
#### Data Source: https://www.kaggle.com/c/facebook-recruiting-iii-keyword-extraction/data
#### Stack Exchange has released this data which consist of Question description, Titles and their Tags.

<p>
Stack Exchange is a network of question-and-answer websites on topics in diverse fields, each site covering a specific topic. The primary purpose of each Stack Exchange site is to enable users to post questions and answer them.<br />
<br />
Our task is to predict the tags (a.k.a. keywords, topics, summaries), given only the question text and its title and create hierarchy of tags. The dataset contains content from disparate stack exchange sites, containing a mix of both technical and non-technical questions.<br />
